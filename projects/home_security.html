                    <h3>Abstract</h3>

                    <p>Our project aims to implement a home security system using the <b>Galileo board</b> and a web camera. This system uses <b>SMS</b> services to notify the user and <b>e-mails</b> a picture taken from the web cam to the user.</p>
                    <p>The system uses image processing to detect <b>motion</b>. So that the Gallileo board is used at its one of optimum potential.</p>

                    <p>And moreover this project takes the traditional CC tv camera systems some intelligence so that they would notify the user at a disturbance without just recording all sorts of unnecessary stuff. So at a critical situation the user can taken necessary actions.</p>

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>

                    <p>This project is a group project for <b>CO-321 Embedded systems</b> based on the <b>Galileo board</b>. Our team thought to do a project which is useful in day to day life. As we researched for couple of days we understood that we could use our resources to achieve security purposes. So that we decided to implement this project.</p>

                    <p>Most of the employees today suffer from the burden of security as they are not at homes at working hours. This increases as their children are left alone while they are out. Sometime the homes are left alone for days or weeks if the family goes for trips or tours. To make the matter worse day by day the number of thefts increase too</p>

                    <p>Our aim was to take this burden off the families using the knowledge gained by the course and the resources to solve this problem. As today's world is inter connected via mobile devices and internet the modern way of security has reached a new level. Our idea is to ensure security via this new technology.</p>

                    <p>Gallieo Board is a smart enough micro controller which even a linux or any other OS can be run on top it. And image processing is a now days a emerging technology which has a huge potentiality in many fields. This project mainly focuses on using image processing and gallieo board to implement a home security system. This takes the home security system to the next level.</p>


                    <p>This system would be useful to houses which are with people with busy lifestyles. Now a day’s most of the people have a smart phone in their hands all the time. By this project these smart device can be used to be alerted about the security of the homes of modern busy people.</p>

                    <p>This project mainly focuses on developing a security system for homes which would notify the owner at a disturbance at his or her home. This project would help the uses by releasing the extra pressure of security problems when they are away from homes.</p>

                    <h3>Literature Review</h3>

                    <p>There are security cameras with motion detection on market. This project is done using a <b>Arduino Yun</b>. It also has motion detection and picture sending with video streaming.<a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/wireless-security-camera-arduino-yun/introduction">read</a></p>

                    <p>This is one project that only acts as a cc tv camera and this uses <b>Rasberry pie</b> board <a href=" http://www.averagemanvsraspberrypi.com/2014/09/turn-raspberry-pi-into-cctv-security.html">read</a></p>


                    <p>Most of the projects done in this fields either users <b>motion sensors</b> or switching triggers at an disturbance. But in this project image processing is used as this would enable to use <b>Gallieo board</b> with its true potential.</p>


                    <h3>Requirement Analysis</h3>

                    <p>Project Requirements</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Taking photos using a web camera at a disturbance.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Triggering a buzzer.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Sending the user a SMS.</b></li>
                        <li><b>E-mailing the taken photos.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Controlling the system through e-mail.</b></li>
                    </ul>


                    <h3>System Design and Architecture</h3>

                    <p>The <b>galleo board</b> is a microcontroller which is capable of installing a <b>OS</b> on tp of it using a <b>SD card</b>. Once the OS is installed the board can run phthon codes and even connect to the internet so that it would be enough to implement our project.</p>


                    <p>So this project mainly focuses on running <b>python</b> and <b>open CV</b> image processing libraries on top of the <b>Galileo board</b>. For this there should be algorithms developed and coded in <b>python</b> for image processing and sending data. And <b>Linux operating system</b> should be installed on the <b>Gallio board</b> usind an <b>SD card</b>. Assembling and testing Hardware components should be done .Finally testing product for all possible test cases.</p>

                    <p>.</p>

                    <h3>Methodology & Implementation Details</h3>

                    <p>The <b>Linux operating system</b> was installed to the microcontroller using an <b>SD card</b> the <b>python scripts</b> can be run and the board is given an <b>ip address</b> and can be connected to <b>internet</b>. The system has a separate <b>G-Mail account</b> which only has the contact of the user and only interacts with him</p>

                    <p>The system periodically checks the last e-mail of the systems inbox. If the last e-mail <b>“ON”</b> the system is activated. If it consists <b>“OFF”</b> the system is deactivated. If it consist of <b>“SEND”</b> or <b>“STOPSEND”</b> the process of emailing images starts or stops</p>

                    <p>The algorithm for image processing is straight forward. Open CV library is used for image processing. Photos are taken at each second. Then the sum each pixels RGB value is compared with the value of the previous value. If the difference is large there has been a motion taken place.</p>



                    <p><b>IMAP  library</b> is used to send and receive mail.<br>

<b>Mraa library</b> is used to activate the pins for the <b>buzzer</b>. To activate the <b>buzzer PWM is used</b>.<br>

SMS is send VIA a pre paid <b>gateway</b> site. <b>“textbiz.lk”</b><br>

Once the system is installed the user can control it using sending an e-mail with <b>“ON”</b> command. At a disturbance the system sends an SMS via the <b>message gateway</b> site. And the buzzer is activated.<br>

By e-mailing the <b>“SEND”</b> command the taken images are emailed to the user. If <b>“OFF”</b> is E-mailed the system stops and the buzzer is deactivated.</p>
