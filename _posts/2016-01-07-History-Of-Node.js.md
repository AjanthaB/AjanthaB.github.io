## **History Of Node.js**

Node.js is a platform built around Google Chrome V8 Javascript engine, to create lightweight, fast, scalable, event-driven and non-blocking I/O applications by Ryan Dahl in May 2009. It has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in Web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications. Node.js has become wildly popular, with programmers everywhere using it to create APIs and build new web applications. Joyent has been the chief sponsor of Node.js from the beginning.

Node.js is a runtime system for creating (mostly) server-side applications. It's best known as a popular means for JavaScript coders to build real-time Web APIs. Node.js have several excellent frameworks including Express.js, Restify.js, and Hapi.js for building rich high customizable web applications. Also, Node.js have operating systems wrappers, microcontrollers, and robots.

The initial release of node.js supports only Linux OS. Dahl was inspired to create Node.js after seeing a file upload progress bar on Flickr. The browser did not know how much of the file had been uploaded and had to query the Web server. Dahl desired an easier way. Dahl demonstrated the project at the inaugural European JSConf on November 8, 2009. Node.js combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop and a low-level I/O API.

The package Manager called NPM was introduces In 2011. The creator of the package manager was Isaac Schlueter. The package manager makes it easier for programmers to publish and share the source code of Node.js libraries and is designed to simplify installation, updating, and uninstallation of libraries.

In June 2011, Microsoft and Joyent implemented a native Windows version of Node.js. The first Node.js build supporting Windows was released in July 2011.

In January 2012, Dahl stepped aside, promoting coworker and npm creator Isaac Schlueter to manage the project. In December 2014, Fedor Indutny started io.js, a fork of Node.js. Due to internal conflict over Joyent's governance, io.js was created as an open governance alternative with a separate technical committee. Unlike Node.js, the authors planned to keep io.js up-to-date with the latest releases of the Google V8 JavaScript engine. In February 2015, the intent to form a neutral Node.js Foundation was announced.

By June 2015, the Node.js and io.js communities voted to work together under the Node.js Foundation. In September 2015, Node.js v0.12 and io.js v3.3 were merged back together into Node v4.0. This brought V8 ES6 features into Node.js and a long-term support release cycle. As of 2016, the io.js website recommends that developers switch back to Node.js. the latest release of the Node.js is v6.2.0.
